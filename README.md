# qrcode

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Here is an example of code that generates a QR code in a Flutter app using the **`qr_flutter`**
package, which takes an input URL from the user and displays it as an image in a box:

1. **First, the `qr_flutter` package is added to the `pubspec.yaml` file. This package provides the necessary classes and functions to generate QR codes in a Flutter app.**
2. **Next, the `qr_flutter` package is imported in the Dart code. This makes the classes and functions from the package available to the rest of the code.**
3. **A stateful widget called `QRCodeGenerator` is created, which takes an input URL from the user and generates a QR code from it. This widget has an associated state class `_QRCodeGeneratorState` that handles the behavior of the widget.**
4. **In the `build` method of the state class, a `TextField` widget is used to allow the user to input a URL. The `onChanged` callback is set on the TextField to update the state variable `_inputURL` with the new value entered by the user every time the value changes.**
5. **Then, a `SizedBox` widget is added with a height of 20 pixels to create some space between the TextField and the QR code.**
6. **After that, an `if` statement is used to check whether the `_inputURL` is empty or not. If the `_inputURL` is empty, a `Text` widget with a message "Enter a URL to generate QR code" is displayed.**
7. **If the `_inputURL` is not empty, a `Container` widget is used to display the generated QR code. The `Container` widget is given a width and a height of 200 pixels and a border of 1 pixel is added to the container using a `BoxDecoration` widget.**
8. **Inside the `Container` widget, the `QrImage` widget from the `qr_flutter` package is used to generate the QR code from the input URL. The `QrImage` widget takes the input URL as the `data` parameter, and you can customize the size and version of the QR code using the `size` and `version` parameters respectively.**
9. **Finally, the `QRCodeGenerator` widget is used in the app's build method to display the QR code generator and the generated QR code.**
